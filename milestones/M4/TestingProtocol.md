# Usability Testing Protocol

## Preparation and set up

### Equipment

Due to Covid-19, we decide to meet each participant on a video call for the usability testing.

The participants should have:
- A computer with a microphone and webcam
- A telephone where they can share the screen
- Internet connection
- Basic knowledge of English

The observers/notetakers should have: 
- A computer with a microphone and webcam
- A program for video and audio recording
- Something to take notes
- The script and the list of tasks that the facilitator will read to the participant

The facilitator should have:
- A computer with a microphone and webcam
- The script and the list of tasks that he will read to the participant

### Roles during Usability Test

During the usability test, we decided to have *one facilitator*, *one observer*, and *two notetakers*. For each test, our roles changed.

### Artifacts

- [Informed consent form (link to the PDF file)](./InformedConsentForm.pdf)
- Post-test questionnaire


## Participants

We decided to do the evaluations with **three people**, one for each category of people we have delineated inside our target population (**beginner, intermediate, expert**).

These are the three categories of people:

1. *Beginner users:* they organize expenses in a rough and superficial way because of their low involvement and inexperience. They have rare and sporadic planning of expenses.

2. *Intermediate users:* they try to organize and plan expenses in a complete way but, due to their lack of experience, they make mistakes that lead them to don’t always have optimal planning.

3. *Expert users:* they organize and divide expenses accurately and meticulously through the use of appropriate tools such as tables and spreadsheets. They are used to keeping under control the financial situation by planning the largest expenses.

To find participants, we decide to involve people we know and to find at least one person per category. These people had not been interviewed in previous milestones and had never seen or used the application.

# Script

## Introduction

[ *Give the user the link for participating in the video call and wait for him/her participating* ]

Hi, ___________. My name is ___________, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today. First of all, I want to thank you for participating in this study.

Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.
You probably already have an idea of why you are here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using a mobile app that we’re working on so we can see whether it works as intended. The session should take about half an hour.

An important thing I want to make clear is that **we’re testing the app itself, not you**. You can’t do anything wrong here. We don’t want you to worry about making mistakes. 
Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve it, so we need to hear your honest reactions. We appreciate your feedback and impression about the app.

If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in seeing how people use the app when they are alone without someone next to them to help. Only in some tasks, I will ask you to describe your actions and decisions and in others, we will collaborate by asking each other questions.
At the end of the session, I will ask you some recap questions. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.

With your permission, we’re going to record what happens on the screen and our conversation. The recording will only be used to help us figure out how to improve the app, and it won’t be seen by anyone except the people working on this project. Also, a few people are observing this session in the call.

Do you have any questions so far? 

[ *Give him/her a recording permission form* ]

<br>

## First screen tour

OK, great. We can start looking at the app.

[ *Send the link for the application in the video call chat* ]

First, I’m going to ask you to open up the link I sent you in the chat with Chrome on your mobile and share your screen. 

[ *Start the screen recorder on your laptop* ]

This is the application you will test today.

This is a financial app where you can manage your expenses and make a saving plan to understand how much money is left to spend before exceeding the budget planned.

Now, before you start doing anything, I’ll give you some minute to familiarize with the application and the tabs. You can behave like when you download an app for the first time.

You can scroll and navigate through the app if you want.

[ *Let the user have a little tour in the app for 2-3 minutes* ]

<br>

## Tasks

Now I’m going to ask you to try the app doing some specific tasks. 

[ *Read aloud and slowly every task to the user and for those with a precise methodology explain them.*

*Allow him/her to proceed until you don’t feel like it’s producing any value or he/she becomes very frustrated.*

*Before starting the new task, ask confirmation to the user and to observers to proceed in order to let everyone be ready.*

*Repeat for each task or until time runs out* ]

## Questionnaire

Thanks, that was very helpful.
I’ll give you a little questionnaire to have feedback about the test.

- **Is the application easy to use?**

[ *Ask the observers’ questions, then prove anything you want to follow up on* ]

Some possible follow-up questions:

- Do you think it is useful for planning your expenses?
- [ *Do other follow-up questions based on the result of the questionnaire* ]
- Do you have any suggestions for us?

<br>

## Wrapping up

Thanks a lot for the help you give us today. Do you have any questions for me, now that we’re done?

[ *Stop the screen recorder and save the file.*

*Thank the user and invite him to get out from the video call* ]
